Steps:

1. Unzip CytonSolver v1.1.3b (choose one that appropriate for your OS) in 'release' folder
1.1. (MAC) Simply double click CytonSolver application
1.2. (WIN) Navigate to CytonSolver folder -> scroll down to find CytonSolver.exe (do NOT move this file! Make a shortcut to the desktop if you wish)

IMPORTANT!! (At this point please have a look at the example data files, and interrogate the data format)

2. Import example data file
2.1. You can directly import the provided files by "File->Open..." or Ctrl+O/CMD+O. However, importing this data format is not recommended.

2.2. Instead drag & drop data file into "Cohort Explorer v2018.05.09" and wait for it to finish the analysis
2.3. Notice the new folder (same name as the input data file) located in the same folder as the data file. 
     Note that the program will NOT overwrite if it has exisiting folder.
2.4. Find an output excel file. It should also be named after the input data file with suffix _4prism. (e.g. DATA_FILE_NAME_4prism.xlsx)
2.4. Import DATA_FILE_NAME_4prism.xlsx from Cyton Solver
-NB: YES, you may stop at step2.1. and not bother to run Cohort Explorer, however, it is always a good practice to check your data
before getting into the modelling. Perhaps it will give you an insight on what to expect from the model or find outlier(s). step2.2 is
also a good way of checking the data format as it returns guide for any errors it encounters.

3. Please refer to the manual for utilising the program. It should be located inside 'doc' folder
